# buy-close-sell-open
I was trying to compare the returns of buying the SP500 on **Close** price and selling it the next day on **Open** price.

I mean there was already a comparision about that. But I was curious how it'd perform if I only buy it if the close price is above the EMA200.

So I made this notebook for that comparision.

In conclusion it does give slightly more return with a slightly improved win rate. But it kinda sucks when using it on the data of only last 10 years.
